## Size Vs. Baseball Play

### Summary

This Project was designed to create data vizualization to best report findings. I chose the baseball play data at bat which focused on the measurables and the play at bat. First viewing the relationship of the two styles of play. I focused on size, height and weight vs the play style at bat. Once viewing the trends I wanted to see the relationship in total size, showing the calculation of the BMI which computes size by height squared vs play. Findings where generally bigger size resulted in lower averages but higher home runs.

### Design

 > Floated the Home Run and Averages Filters to empasize the charts affected.
 
 > Stretched the Sizes across the point to emphasize that the filter effects both charts
 
 > Used Trend Lines to emphsaze the slope.

### Feedback

> Filters unclear as to what is affected

> Trends hard to discern in certain settings

#### Post Review Feedback:

> Remove Abbreviations for Clarity
